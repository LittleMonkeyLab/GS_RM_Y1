All participants are asked to lie about a recent experience\n# \n# 2. Experimental group: \n#    - Must count backwards from 100 by 7s while lying (high cognitive load)\n# \n# 3. Control group:\n#    - Simply lie without additional task (normal cognitive load)\n# \n# 4. Measure dependent variables:\n#    - Speech hesitations\n#    - Speech rate\n#    - Amount of detail provided\n#    - Perceived believability (rated by independent judges)\n# \n# 5. Compare measures between groups to assess the effect of cognitive load on lying behavior\n\n# This design allows us to isolate the effect of increased cognitive load on various aspects of lying behavior.\n\n\nThis set of exercises covers various aspects of deception psychology, including theories, research methods, and key findings.
