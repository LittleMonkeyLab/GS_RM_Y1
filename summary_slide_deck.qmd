## Recapitulating the Basics in R  
**Data Skills Refresher – 2025-02-13**

We aim to reinforce key R coding skills covered so far in **Data Skills**, helping you gain confidence in:

- Clearing the workspace  
- Importing data  
- Checking basic properties of data  
- Plotting and running basic analyses  

🔗 See R scripts on the VLE:  
<https://learn.gold.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=30260>

## Clearing the Workspace

Before starting new work, it's often helpful to clear residual variables.

````r
rm(list = ls())
````

This removes all existing objects from the environment.

---

## Importing Data – Excel

If using **RStudio Server**, load Excel data with:

````r
library(readxl)
my_data <- read_excel("your_file.xlsx")
````

If using **local R**, adjust the file path appropriately:

````r
my_data <- read_excel("C:/Users/YourName/Documents/your_file.xlsx")
````

---

## Importing Data – CSV

No special library needed for CSV:

````r
my_data <- read.csv("your_file.csv")
````

Ensure the file path is correct relative to your working directory.

---

## Checking the Data

Explore your dataset with these built-in functions:

````r
summary(my_data)
str(my_data)
````

- `summary()` gives basic statistics.  
- `str()` shows variable types and structure.

---

## Accessing Data Columns

Use the **$ symbol** to access specific variables:

````r
my_data$EXTRAVERSION
````

---

## Correlation Analysis

Calculate the correlation between two variables:

````r
cor.test(my_data$EXTRAVERSION, my_data$MEDIA.USE)
````

### Output includes:
- Correlation coefficient (**r**) from -1 to +1  
- **p-value**: tests if r = 0  
- **Confidence interval** for the estimate

---

## Linear Regression

Fit a simple regression model:

````r
model <- lm(EXTRAVERSION ~ MEDIA.USE, data = my_data)
summary(model)
````

### Output provides:
- **Coefficients** (intercept & slope)  
- **R-squared**: variance explained  
- **p-values**: significance of predictors

---

## Basic Scatter Plot

````r
plot(my_data$MEDIA.USE, my_data$EXTRAVERSION,
     col = "blue",
     xlab = "Media Use",
     ylab = "Extraversion")
````

---

## Customising Plot Labels

- Variable names are **case-sensitive**:  
  ✅ `my_data$EXTRAVERSION`  
  ❌ `my_data$extraversion`

- Custom y-axis label:

````r
ylab = "Extraversion"
````

Or even:

````r
ylab = "My Cat"
````

---

## Customising Plot Colours

Change the colour to any base or HEX colour:

````r
col = "#9226c5"  # purple tone
````

🎨 Try this HEX picker:

## Summary

Today we reviewed:

- How to clean and import data in R  
- Summarising datasets  
- Running correlation and regression analyses  
- Creating and customising scatter plots  

Keep exploring the **R scripts** on the VLE for more practice.  
You're making great progress!
